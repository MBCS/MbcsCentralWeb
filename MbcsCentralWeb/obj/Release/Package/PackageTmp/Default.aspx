        <div style="font-size:24px; color:#0397DE; text-align:center;"><b>The Property Management System has moved to the Web!</b></div>
        <br />
        &nbsp;What you can do with <b>MbcsCentral</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>Run it from the web where ever you have internet access.</li>
            <li>Install it on one or more of your computers and run it locally.</li>
            <li>Use both of the above options (Dual Run) for maximum flexibility.</li>
            <li>Which ever RUN option you use you can choose from the following Database options:
                <ul>
                    <li>Store your data in a Cloud Database utilizing Microsoft's highly secure and robust Azure&#8482; Platform</li>
                    <li>Store your data on your office network.</li>
                    <li>Store your data both in the Cloud and locally with automatic replication between the two.<br />
                        Your local database and the Cloud Database will update each other so no matter which one is used the other will be current.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Utilize up-to-date Database server technology: Microsoft SQL Server.<br />
                The Express Edition (which is free) can be installed on your local file server.<br />
                The Cloud Database is included with the Cloud run or dual run options.<br />
                A Cloud Database can be added to a local only install.</li>
            <li>Take advantage of fine-grained user permissions to each function of each application.</li>
            <li>Current clients will be able to easily import their current database to SQL Server.</li>
        </ul>  
        <div style="text-align:center;"> 
            &nbsp;Security is tight and each client's data will be completely separate from and not accessible to any other client.<br /><br />
