    Until this point, the logins have been for gaining access to the cloud servers.  Now you are ready to login to the MbcsCentral application.
    <br /><br />
    In actual use, all persons to whom to you grant access will use the system assigned client username and password to access the server.  For each authorized person you 
    will assign a separte username and password as well as a set of permissions. The permissions determine what parts of the program they can access and whether
    or not they will be able to make changes.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Password: Demo
    <br /><br />
    Once successfully logged in the MbcsCentral Menu will appear.  You are ready to explore.
