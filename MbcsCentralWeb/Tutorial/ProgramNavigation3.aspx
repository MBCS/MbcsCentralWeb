    This screen shows a summary of a tenant's account as well as information about leases, and legal 
    status.  From here you can drill down into account, tenant, and unit details.
    <br /><br />
    The other tabs hint at the wide range of information stored for each tenant as well as two of the
    available add-on applications: Tenant Relationship Management (WinTRM) [Alerts], and Document Scanning and
    Management (WinDOC) [Documents]. These tabs are now empty since this is only a demo of WinPM.
    <br /><br />
    Take some time to explore.
